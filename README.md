Here is a README.md for the 4getXSS tool:

4getXSS - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability Scanner
4getXSS is a powerful tool designed to automatically scan web applications for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It uses a variety of payloads to detect vulnerabilities, and it provides results in both JSON and HTML formats.

Warning: Only use this tool on systems you have explicit permission to scan. Unauthorized use of this tool is illegal and can result in severe legal consequences.

Features
Automated XSS Scanning: Scans target URLs with a wide variety of XSS payloads.
Concurrent Scanning: Utilizes multiple threads to speed up the scanning process.
Result Formats: Saves findings in both JSON  formats.
WebDriver Integration: Uses Selenium WebDriver for rendering and interacting with web pages.
Custom Payload Support: Load your own list of XSS payloads for scanning.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Selenium
Chrome WebDriver (installed automatically via webdriver-manager)
colorama
requests
threading
queue
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/4getXSS.git
cd 4getXSS
Install required Python packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that Chrome and ChromeDriver are installed on your system.

Usage
After installation, run the script:


python 4getXSS.py
You will be prompted to:

Enter target URLs (comma-separated).
Provide the path to a file containing XSS payloads.
Set a timeout for detecting XSS alerts.
After scanning, the tool will prompt you to generate an HTML report if vulnerabilities are found.

Example Usage

$ python 4getXSS.py
Enter target URLs (comma-separated): https://example.com, https://testsite.com
Enter the path to the XSS payload file: payloads.txt
Enter the timeout for detecting alerts (seconds): 10
Result Format
JSON Format: After a scan, you will receive a results.json file containing detailed information on detected vulnerabilities, including the vulnerable URLs and the payloads that triggered them.

HTML Report: Optionally, you can generate an HTML report which will be saved to a file, detailing the scan results in a human-readable format.

Legal Warning
4getXSS is an educational and ethical tool for security researchers. Only use it on applications you own or have explicit permission to test.

Using this tool without authorization is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences, including criminal prosecution. Use at your own risk.
